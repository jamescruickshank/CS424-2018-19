    "\n",
    "* Any client state that we wish to preserve must be _stored in the client_ and sent along with subsequent requests \n",

    "# The Django User model and Authentication System\n",
    "\n",
    "Django provides a user friendly API for managing the authentication process. This is based around the class `django.contrib.auth.User` which automatically handles all the cookie management and provides easy hooks for authentication. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are various standard views in a typical authentication system - login, logout, password reset, etc. We could implement them from scratch but Django provides well designed and easy-to-use implementations out of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "Authentication is typically a project wide process, so usually the urls are defined at the project level rather than in a particular app. See the demo app for a system example of this in action.\n",
