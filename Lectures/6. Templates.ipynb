    "The template layer of Django deals with the process of producing the HTML content in the response. A **template** is a document that defines how a particular piece of data is presented to the end user.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Don't Repeat Yourself** (DRY) is a guiding principle here - typical web apps contain many pages that a lot of HTML in common. Generally the common elements should appear in only one template\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Presentation logc**: this is any logic that is strictly concerned with how the data is presented to the end user. For example, in our sample app we might want to diaplay a list of all Members, but only display email addresses for those over 18. We can implement this logic in the template since it is to do with data presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ** Business logic** This is the logic that encodes the real world \"business\" rules concerning the data. For example we might want to compute a subscription fee for members based on age, number of years, role in the club, etc... This type of logic should appear in views and/or models as it is business logic\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally presentation logic should not be overly complex. If you find yourself creatiing complicated logic within a template, you're probably not doing it right. Either you need more templates or you need to move some logic into a view or a model\n"
