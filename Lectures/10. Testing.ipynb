    "**Unit tests** are tests that test some small piece of code in isolation. They are crucial for debugging complex code. For example we might want to test that a particular method of a certain model does what it is supposed to\n",
    "\n",
    "**end-to-end testing** involves testing a large section of application functionality through the entrire workflow associated with that section. For example, we might want to test that the sign-up process for a website is working correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**setup and teardown** are the typically necessary parts of an application test suite. We might have to create some test data for our tests to work (setup) and we want this data to diasappear after testing (teardown)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has the `unittest` module to assist with creating tests. This can be used with Django, but Django ships with its own testing system that is wrapped around unittest and provides some extra features that are useful for web dev (especially for view testing)\n"
